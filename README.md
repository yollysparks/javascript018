Period 1

Typescript
Q: Explain and Reflect:

•	Explain differences between Java and JavaScript. You should include both topics related to the fact that Java is a compiled language and JavaScript a scripted language, and general differences in language features.

A: Key differences between Java and JavaScript:
 
•	Java is an OOP programming language while Java Script is an OOP scripting language.
•	Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser while JavaScript code is run on a browser only.
•	Java code needs to be compiled while JavaScript code are all in text.
•	They require different plug-ins.

Q:•	Explain the two strategies for improving JavaScript: ES6 (es2015) + ES7, versus Typescript. What does it require to use these technologies: In our backend with Node and in (many different) Browsers.

Q: •	Explain generally about node.js, and when it “makes sense” and npm, and how it “fits” into the node echo system.

Q: •	Explain about the Event Loop in Node.js

Q: •	Explain (some) of the purposes with the tools Babel and WebPack, using  examples from the exercises

Q: •	Explain the purpose of “use strict” and also Linters, exemplified with ESLint 

Q: Explain using sufficient code examples the following features in JavaScript. 
   •	Variable/function-Hoisting

A: Hoisting is JavaScript's default behaviour of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current     script or the current function).
   
•	this in JavaScript and how it differs from what we know from Java/.net.

•	Function Closures and the JavaScript Module Pattern

•	Immediately-Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)

•	JavaScripts Prototype

•	User defined Callback Functions

•	Explain the methods map, filter and reduce

•	Provide examples of user defined reusable modules implemented in Node.js
ES6-7 and TypeScript

•	Provide examples and explain the es2015 features: let, arrow functions, this, rest parameters, de-structuring assignments, maps/sets etc.

•	Explain and demonstrate how es2015 supports modules (import and export) similar to what is offered by NodeJS.

•	Provide an example of ES6 inheritance and reflect over the differences between Inheritance in Java and in ES6.

•	Provide examples with es6, running in a browser, using Babel and Webpack

•	Provide an number of examples to demonstrate the benefits of using TypeScript, including, types, interfaces, classes and generics
Callbacks, Promises and async/await


Explain about promises in ES-6 including, the problems they solve, a quick explanation of the Promise API and:
•	Example(s) that demonstrate how to avoid the callback hell  (“Pyramid of Doom")
•	Example(s) that demonstrate how to execute asynchronous code in serial or parallel
•	Example(s) that demonstrate how to implement our own promise-solutions.
•	Example(s) that demonstrate error handling with promises

Explain about JavaScripts async/await, how it relates to promises and reasons to use it compared to the plain promise API.

Provide examples to demonstrate 
Why this often is the preferred way of handling promises
Error handling with async/await
Serial or parallel execution with async/await.
